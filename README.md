# Coming Soon

This readme is highly incomplete at the moment, but it is worth mentioning the most important thing right away:

This project depends on another project, metaheuristics-engine.  It is a Java library, but it is not in any maven repo.  It must be checked out and installed manually into your local maven repository before this project will compile.
